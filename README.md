# Virtual Wizard

## Overview
**Virtual Wizard** is a fantasy, story-driven, turn-based mobile game that uses smartphone sensors for an interactive spell-casting experience. Players perform real-world gestures to cast spells, and the accuracy of these gestures affects the spell's power and effect. The game features branching storylines and multiple endings, making player choices meaningful.  

> **Note:** This project was done as a coursework for **Mobile App Development**. The game is not fully complete, and there are several improvements and features that could not be implemented within the limited time of the previous semester.
